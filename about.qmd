## My Journey

My programming journey began at the University of Toronto, where I worked as a teaching assistant and MASc student, developing a subroutine for Vector2—a non-linear finite element software ([vectoranalysisgroup.com](https://vectoranalysisgroup.com)). This experience ignited my passion for combining structural engineering with software development.

That passion evolved into full-stack web development when I created a resource management SaaS for my former company using Laravel and Vue.js. Currently, I'm developing ETABSPY and SAFEPY—Python programs that connect to ETABS and SAFE to retrieve structural analysis data and automate design tasks such as shear wall design and slab design, leveraging data science libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization. EngSheet continues this journey, built as a single-page application with Vue.js that runs blazingly fast and works seamlessly in the browser, with interactive visualizations powered by D3.js.

## My Passion for Running

Running has become a big part of who I am. What started as just a way to stay active slowly turned into something I actually look forward to—a space to think, reset, and challenge myself. There's something about the rhythm of running that helps me find focus; it clears my head and reminds me that progress usually comes one step at a time. I'm not chasing records—I'm chasing consistency. Whether I'm training for a 5K or just getting out for a quick evening run, it's where I test my limits, process my thoughts, and find a bit of balance in everything else going on.

## Staying Active: Boxing, Tennis, and the Gym

Beyond running, I stay active through boxing, tennis, and regular gym sessions. Boxing teaches me discipline and focus—every round demands presence and precision. Tennis brings out my competitive side while keeping things fun and social. The gym ties it all together, building the strength and endurance that support everything else. These activities aren't just about fitness; they're about maintaining balance, pushing boundaries, and finding different ways to challenge myself physically and mentally.

## My Passion for Piano

Playing piano has always been a personal escape for me, a way to slow down and express thoughts that words can't quite capture. I'm drawn to how a few keys and chords can shift a whole mood, and how much focus and patience it takes to bring a piece to life. It's where I learn balance between precision and creativity, discipline and emotion. Whether I'm learning a new song or just improvising, piano is my reset button—something that keeps me grounded while letting my mind wander freely.
